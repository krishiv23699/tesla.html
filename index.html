    <title>5 Reasons Why You Should And Shouldn't Buy A Tesla</title>

          <h1>Tesla - Yes or No?</h1>


    <p>Teslas are great - or are they? Today I am sharing with you why you should and shouldn't buy a Tesla - 5 reasons each.
        Let's begin with:</p>

    <h2>5 Reasons Why?</h2>

    <h3>1. It's eco-friendly.</h3>

    <div class="tesla-car"><img src ="images/Tesla_Model_Y.webp" alt="m3"></div>

    <p>This is the most obvious reason - it's an electric car, meaning it doesn't use any fossil fuels so it's good for
        the air. Some people don't pay much attention this one, but it actually
        makes a big difference in the air quality.
    </p>

    <h3>2. It's cost-efficient.</h3>

    <p>Teslas are expensive, there's no way to sugarcoat that, but they cost around $615 per year to charge. In
        comparison, cars that run on fuel cost an average, actually a shocking
        $1,850 a year to refuel, meaning Teslas themselves save you $1235 a year in the long run.
    </p>

    <h3>3. They don't need a lot of maintenance.</h3>

    <p>There is nothing - literally nothing - in the bonnet of any given Tesla(this has its problems, but we'll get to
        that in a minute), so you don't need to worry about oiling,
        gas filters, baterries, or any of that.
    </p>

    <h3>4. There's quite a bit of room for luggage.</h3>

    <p>As I mentioned, there is nothing in the bonnet of the car, and that space is actually meant to be used for storing stuff,
        so the back of your car doesn't feel full of things when you go for a long road trip.
    </p>

    <h3>and 5. The Self-Driving tech.</h3>

    <p>Tesla keeps improving its self driving technology, with new features in cars such as the model 3, like Auto Park,
        and Auto Lane Change.
        Needless to say, this is absolutely revolutionary, and can build a foundation for completely driverless cars in
        the near future.
    </p>


    <p>That's 5 reasons why. Now let's move on to:</p>

    <h2>5 Reasons Why Not?</h2>

    <h3>1. They're way too expensive.</h3>

    <p>It's no secret that Teslas are really pricey, and while it does save you some good money in the long run, that
        doesn't justify
        the steep price.
    </p>

    <h3>2. Where's the stuff that makes it a car?</h3>

    <p>As I mentioned before, there's nothing in the bonnet of the vehicle. Not even basic components like the
        carbeuretor, fuel filters,
        not even an engine. The whole car runs on a motherboard, meaning its basically a computer you can ride in. Now,
        this is a really innovative
        feature, and it's pretty ahead of its time, but the only problem with it is that this isn't a good enough reason
        to give it the price that
        it has.
    </p>

    <h3>3. Range and Availability of Charging Stations.</h3>

    <p>
        Now, for example, Tesla's Model 3 has an estimated range of 358 km, which is pretty respectable, but it's still
        less than the range of
        most other gas vehicles, and when you weigh in the fact that there's not a lot of charging stations between a
        lot of 358 km spaces,
        it really is something to look out for.
    </p>

    <h3>4. Tire situation.</h3>

    <p>
        Tesla's tires are not exactly the best on the market, and can wear down pretty easily. Also, to add a little bit
        of icing on the cake,
        Teslas don't give you a spare tire on purchase, meaning if you don't buy one seperately(which is also pretty
        expensive on its own),
        you could blow a tire, and be stranded in the middle of a road, and there will probably be nothing you can do
        about it.
    </p>

    <h3>5. Big no-no in the cold.</h3>

    <p>
        All EVs have a range meter that tells you how much distance you can travel with the amount of batter left, and
        of course, Tesla is no
        exception. The thing is, when the weather gets cold, Tesla's range meters start acting up, and sometimes become
        completely unuseable.
    </p>

    <p> And that's <strong>5 Reasons Why You Should and Shouldn't Buy a Tesla</strong>. Hopefully I was able to
        enlighten some of you.
        Thank you for taking the time to read this page, and I'll see you later. Cheers!</p>
