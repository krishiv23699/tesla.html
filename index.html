    <h1>Tesla: Yes or No?</h1>
    
    <p>Teslas are great - or are they? I asked myself this question a while ago and I couldn't sleep on it, so I set out to find the answers.
     When I did, I thought,"I should share this knowledge with the internet". Hence this website. Today I am sharing with you why you should and shouldn't buy a Tesla - 5 reasons each.
    Let's begin with:</p>

        <h2>5 Reasons Why?</h2>

        <h3>1. It's eco-friendly.</h3>

        <p>This is the most obvious reason - it's an electric car, meaning it doesn't use any fossil fuels so it's good for the air. People kind of sleep on this one, but it actually
            makes a big difference in the air quality. 
        </p>

        <h3>2. It's cost-efficient.</h3>
